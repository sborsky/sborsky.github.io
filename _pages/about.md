I am an environmental economist interested in the spatial interdependencies between individuals and regions. In my research career until today, I have made several empirical contributions to the literature on international trade in raw materials, international environmental agreements and weather induced economic shocks. My current research focusus on how climate variability and climate change affects population dynamics and urban structure. I am currently an assistant professor at the [Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change](https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/en/) at the [University of Graz](https://www.uni-graz.at/en/). I am an associate member of the [Field of Excellence Climate Change Graz](https://climate-change.uni-graz.at/en/) and the [EconClim](https://wegcenter.uni-graz.at/en/research/econclim-research-group/) research group of the Wegener Center.

I completed my PhD at the Economics Department at the University of Innsbruck in 2011 and was postdoctoral research associate at the University of Southern Denmark.
