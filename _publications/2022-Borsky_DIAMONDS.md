This article gives empirical evidence on the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) impact on international trade in rough diamonds. We find that bilateral KPCS participation facilitates access to international markets for rough diamonds and increases trade values. The bilateral  trade impact of the KPCS does not depend on the exporters’ economic  development or market access. A more detailed analysis of exporters’  heterogeneity in trade values shows that unilaterally KPCS intensifies the trade impediments resulting from armed conflicts and, thereby, reduces the international trade in rough diamonds stemming from countries with ongoing internal conflicts. We further offer evidence that the KPCS-induced trade effects apply not only to exporter- or importer-hubs but equally to smaller trade partners. Our analysis gives insights into how agreements setting a particular standard may affect international trade patterns in conflict minerals.
