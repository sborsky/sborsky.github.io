In this paper we examine the effect of the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) on tropical timber trade. The empirical analysis is based on a gravity equation in a  difference-in-difference setting, which is estimated by a panel Heckman's selection model. We then conduct a comprehensive comparative static analysis solving the  structural gravity model with and without the ITTA. This allows us to  determine the trade impact of an ITTA-induced increase in sustainability for participating as well as for third countries. We find that countries participating in the ITTA exhibit a significant and  substantial increase in trade values ranging from 4% to 6%. Furthermore, we observe that this effect is more pronounced for smaller member  countries. Non-ITTA countries are confronted with reduced values of  tropical timber trade flows.
