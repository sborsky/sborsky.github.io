This paper investigates the impact of market concentration on solar home system installations in rural off-grid energy markets of Bangladesh. We use an extensive dataset that includes 4.11 million solar home systems installed in 503 markets over  15 years (2003â€“2017). Figure 1 displays the distribution of solar home systems across thanas over time. We show, as depicted in Figure 2, that an increase in the degree of market concentration reduces both the number and the total capacity of  installed solar home systems after controlling for relevant demand- and supply-side factors. We find heterogeneous effects of market concentration depending on the size of the installed solar home system and customer  group. Our study emphasizes the importance of markets in the emergence and diffusion of renewable energy technologies.
