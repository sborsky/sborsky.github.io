In this paper, we analyze the phosphorus balance as a result of manure  application on the parish level for Denmark and investigate its local  geographic distribution. For our analysis, we determine phosphorus loads for the five main animal groups and the phosphorus demand of the  fifteen major crop categories. Our results show that there is a large  variability in the phosphorus balance within Denmark. Due to industry agglomeration statistically significant hot spots appear mainly along the west coast, while cold spots are predominantly present on southern and eastern  coasts towards the Baltic Sea. The proximity of oversupply areas to  water bodies and other environmentally sensitive areas reinforces the need for further phosphorus regulation. Our findings  show the importance of a combined spatially targeted regulation, which  allows different levels of phosphorus application depending on local  economic and environmental circumstances in combination with subsidizing manure processing technologies in phosphorus hot spots.
