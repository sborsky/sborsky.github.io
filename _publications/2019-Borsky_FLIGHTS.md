Weather shocks frequently impair the smooth functioning of  transportation systems. We use a dataset consisting of 2.14 million  flight departures from ten large U.S. airports between January 2012 and  September 2017, and estimate the effects sudden onset events, i.e., precipitation and wind, and slow onset events, i.e., temperature, have on departure delay. Our estimates show a significant increase in departure delay of up to  23â€¯min depending on the weather type and intensity of the disturbance.  Given the social costs of schedule delays, these results are of high  economic importance.
