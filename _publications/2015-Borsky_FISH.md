This paper provides an empirical analysis of the role of  intergovernmental interaction in countries’ compliance with an  international environmental agreement (IEA). We use two cross-sectional data sets that contain information on signatory countries’ compliance  with an IEA on responsible fisheries. Our empirical strategy is based on estimating a spatial Durbin model using a maximum likelihood procedure. The results show that compliance effort by other participants has a  systematic positive effect on a country’s own compliance. We argue that  these findings provide empirical evidence that intergovernmental relations can improve the performance of voluntary IEAs where other  formal sanction mechanisms are absent.
